            <p>Hi, My name is Diego, and I'm a Computer Science major at Elon University. I come from Burlington, North Carolina and I learned to take some pictures during my graphic design class in High School. In every sense, the teacher taught us a little photo theory. I fell in love with taking pictures with the little bit of picture theory I have. Now you may be wondering why I did this portfolio instead of a coding portfolio, which will be part of it when I'm done making it. Plus, I created this portfolio to enhance my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, but enough with programming talk, why do I like taking pictures? It captures a bit of our life. Trying to get the perfect shot from not only amazing moments in real life but also in video games. You might say that pictures can make anything hold a memory forever and future lives will try to understand that memory that you took. It's an amazing thing to do and I hope you like the pictures that I have provided. If you want me to use some of my work just give me credit for the picture. Thank you for visiting and have a good day.</p>

            <p>P.S., I have an Instagram too if you want to see some more pictures and maybe some early pictures from me.</p>
