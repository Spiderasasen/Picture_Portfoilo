            <p class="leftText"> Thank you so much for taking the time to look at some of the pictures I've captured over the years, using both my cell phone and the photo mode on my gaming console. While I may not claim to be the best photographer, I have genuinely found joy in the art of capturing moments and scenes that speak to me. Each click of the shutter has become a way for me to express my perspective on the world around me. Throughout the years, I’ve developed a greater appreciation for the beauty in both the ordinary and the extraordinary, discovering stories and emotions within the simplest of subjects. Whether it’s a vibrant sunset, a candid moment with friends, or a beautifully crafted scene within a game, each photograph encapsulates a unique memory and a glimpse into my experiences. I hope you enjoy this visual journey as much as I have enjoyed creating it!</p>

            <p class="rightText">The main photo editing software is the basic photo editing software that Google Photos has available. While Google Photos is mainly used to store all the photos that you have taken, there is a photo editing software that will make all your photos sharp and beautiful. Yes it's simple photo editing, but for someone like me who does not know how to navigate Adobe Photoshop, these pictures look amazing</p>
